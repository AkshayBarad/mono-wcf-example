WCF is *Windows Communication Foundation*.\r\n![Mono WCF example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shturm/mono-wcf-example/master/mono-wcf.png)\r\nSome terminology explained:\r\n* `Service` - class that does business logic. .NET considers a class a WCF service when inherits from a\r\n* `Service Contract` - interface annotated with `ServiceContract` attribute and each exposed method with `OperationContract` attribute. Those are available in the `System.ServiceModel` assembly and namespace.\r\n* `Host` - application that hosts the WCF Service. Typically this is IIS. You can tell IIS \"This DLL has a WCF Service - host it for me\" and it will. But .NET includes necessary classes for you to host it in another application (like in this repository).\r\n* `ServiceHost` - .NET class from `System.ServiceModel` that can start hosting specified services. It's used to run the service in custom applications, like this.\r\n* `Binding` - The way (protocol) the service is exposed and consumed. E.g. HTTP, TCP, etc. This example runs with HTTP binding. A `Binding` object is passed to the `ServiceHost` constructor. In IIS you can configure which binding to use for your service.\r\n\r\n## Run\r\n* Open the `WCF.sln` file with either MonoDevelop, Xamarin Studio or Visual Studio.\r\n* Build the solution\r\n* Start the solution\r\n\r\nIt should start two console applications - client and host. In the client console you can type your name and the service will greet you.\r\n\r\n## Structure\r\n* `Client/` Console application - consumes the service.\r\n* `GreeterWcfService/` Class Library - the service itself. Includes business logic + contracts (interfaces) for the service.\r\n* `Host/` Console application - hosts the WCF service via HTTP binding.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
